We already saw what was in the 2018 data, but let’s open the Excel spreadsheets for the other datasets to see how straightforward combining the datasets will be.\nAfter opening up the datasets, here are the primary issues facing us:\n\nColumns have different names between the different datasets. For example,\n\n\n\n\nUp until now, we’ve just been doing EDA stuff. Now that we’ve done some of that, we can get started with modeling. For this series, we’re going to use tidymodels to keep our prediction workflows organized and reproducible.\nAs with most things in programming, there are several different ways to achieve what we’re going to do. This is just one way to do all of that."
